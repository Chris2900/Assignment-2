        <p>The past 5 nba seasons have dominated by a player who seemingly came out of no where. The story of Giannis Antetokoumpo, is one of the most wholesome, and inspireing stories to every cross the eyes of the NBA's fans.</p>
        <p>Giannis was bron in Athens Greece, to a struggleing mother and father of 5. Growing up, Giannis and his brothers would often sell their valubles, in order for them to afford food. Thier days wouldn't always go well, and would often to go sleep hungry. Giannis was first introduced to basketball when his older brother Thanasis, played for a club in Athens. Giannis started off as a towel boy for the team, but would later on be asked to join the younger teams group, because of his height. Giannis and his brothers would often sleep at the teams gym, on the gym mats. He'd also share the same basketball shoes with his brothers, because they weren't able to afford them.</p>
        <p>The first time Giannis had entered the eyes of NBA scouts, was when he played for Filathlitikos B.C. The team had sent out a small scouting tape, with a lot of grain</p>.

        <p>The one thing visible in the grainy video was a teenager, clearly towering over everyone, handleing the ball, and ducking from everywhere. In a now iconic pre-draft interview, Giannis told reporters "i wanna make the NBA". It was clear that he needed a lot of development though. Now all that needed to happen was for an NBA team to take a chance on a kid that barley anybody had heard of. That team would be the Milwaukee Bucks, who selected giannis with the 15th pick of the 2013 NBA draft.</p>
        <p>Entering the NBA, Giannis was a very skinny kid, barley weighing, over 200lbs. But his Hard work ethic, and that constant reminder of his past, where he struggled to eat would motivate him.</p>
