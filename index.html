        <p>James harden entered the 2017-18 NBA with something to prove. Harden wanted to prove to people that they had chose the wrong Person for the award the previous year. That player being OKC's Russell Westbrook. Westbrook Put forward a historic season, being only the second player in NBA history to average a triple double, since the great Oscar Robertson.</p>
        <p> Harden started off the season strong, scoring over 25 point in multiple games. Harden also set an NBA record by setting a new 2nd place record for the second most 30 point games in a row, with 32. though this "2nd" place record didn't satisfy him, as he wanted the first place mvp award. the highlight of Hardens MVP year was when he scored 61 points, 7 rebounds, 3 steals, and hit 9 threes against the San antonio spurs.</p>

        <p>The Houston rockets entered the playoffs as the 1st seed, and were set to play the  Minnesota Timberwolves, who they dispatched of in a gentlemans sweep, winning the series 4-1. The Second round went the exact same way, as Houston ended the Utah Jazz's season winning the series 4-1. Houston made it all the way to the western confrence finals, and faced off againt the defending champs, the Golden State Warriors. Houston entered the series expeted to lose, but surprised everyone as they had the warriors almost beaten, and needed 1 more series win to advance to the NBA finals. It seems as though thier luck ran out, because in game 6, Houstons all star point guard Chris Paul tore his hamstring, and didn't return to the series. Golden state took advantage of this and came back to win the game. All of the Houstons luck had gone out the door come game 7, because the team would go on to miss 27 straight 3's, and failed to stop the star studded warriors, and eventually lost the sereies.</p>
        <p>Dispite they way His team went out, the nba voters couldn't ignore the magical season James Harden had put up. This led to him being named the KIA 2017-18 NBA MVP.</p>
